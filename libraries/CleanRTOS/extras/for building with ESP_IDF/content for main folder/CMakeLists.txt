# Of course, it's up to you where you choose to store your libraries.

# My personal choice has been not to add any additional libraries to the
# libraries folder of the Arduino component.

# Instead additional libraries - CleanRTOS and any other third party libraries,
# I chose to store in a folder called "libs", which resides in the same folder
# as the folder "main" does.

# Thus, it stays clear for me which libraries came with the standard Arduino component
# and which ones I added myself.

# Note: CleanRTOS does not depend on the standard Arduino component, so 
# you can ommit that as you like.

# Edit following two lines to set component requirements (see docs)
