This internals folder contains code that is used by CleanRTOS.
It is generally discouraged/not needed to use that code directly:

crt_FreeRTOS.h   -  This header includes all parts of freertos that CleanRTOS is built on.
                It is included by CleanRTOS.h

crt::std::Stack - This is a simple, high performant stack that is internally used by 
                MutexSection.

TaskCriticalSection - Use of this class is generally bad practice and a sign that your
                software architecture should be improved.
