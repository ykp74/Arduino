Logging

For reasons of speed, logging is not mutex protected. 
As a consequence, there is a race condition.
In very rare cases, a log may be lost.

The positive side of it is that logging is as fast as it gets.
A log takes about 0.25 us. (protecting against the race condition
would make it at least 10 times as slow). Because of its speed,
without much worry about performance penalties, you can add a 
lot of logs.

How to use it:
In main.cpp:
Logger<100> theLogger("Logger", 2 /*priority*/, ARDUINO_RUNNING_CORE, pinButtonDump);/*, buttonHandler);*/
ILogger& logger(theLogger);	

Everywhere else:
#include "crt_ILogger.h"
extern crt::ILogger& logger;

logger.LogText("bla");
logger.LogInt32(-1);
logger.LogUin32(232);

To show the log, press the button (negative logic) that is connected to the logger.
